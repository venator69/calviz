# üßÆ Calculus Virtual Lab ‚Äî Calviz

**Calviz** is a web-based virtual laboratory developed as part of the **Midterm Exam** for  
**II3140 ‚Äì Web and Mobile Application Development**.

The platform provides **interactive materials and visualizations** designed to help students grasp fundamental **Calculus** concepts through direct, hands-on exploration.

## üí° Core Features and Implementation

### 1. Interactive Visualization Modules (Front-end)

The website includes **three main modules**, each utilizing the `<canvas>` API for real-time, client-side rendering.

| **Module** | **Concept** | **Key Interactions** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Riemann Integral | Area under a curve | Adjust partition count (`n`) and sampling methods (Left, Right, Midpoint) to observe convergence toward the exact integral. |
| Derivative | Limit definition of derivative | Use a slider to vary Œît and visualize the secant line approaching the tangent line. |
| Taylor Series | Power series approximation | Modify the number of terms to see how the function‚Äôs approximation improves within its radius of convergence. |

### 2. Advanced Server-Side Implementation

The back-end introduces several **advanced, session-based functionalities**:

- **Session-Based Authentication:**  
  Implemented via Express Sessions, with persistent session data stored in PostgreSQL.  
  Supports both **standard login** and **Google OAuth** authentication.

- **User Progress Persistence:**  
  Authenticated users can **save and retrieve** their completion status for each module through secure API endpoints:  
  - `POST /api/progress/save`  
  - `GET /api/progress/get`
